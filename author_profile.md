Be a good dude who take crap off someone when it comes to Ƀitcoin!

The self-fulfilling prophecy of Bitcoin rising, is the reason why interesting related stuff about the current development is noted here.

As a Bitcoin Lightning Network Evangelist and Webdeveloper I like to share my findings about implementing bitcoin and its 2nd layer lightning network for online and offline use cases.

There a many innovative ideas and tools to receive, send and store Bitcoin Satoshis and it could be a great decision to stack sats for anyone!

More things will come up soon…

Stay save and tuned!
