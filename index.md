## ...and welcome stranger!
This is my homebase which exists of reasons.

Feel free to read my writings and get in touch if you like.

I am that guy who take crap off someone when it comes to Internet Developement and Media Design.

As a digital pioneer i am into the internet since 1995 and I like to share my experience about websites and use cases.

For some time my focus has been on Bitcoin.  There a so many innovative ideas and tools to receive, send and store Bitcoin Satoshis that need to be shared.

Take a look around and get inspired, you may find useful information here or you are wasting your time - find out :-)


Stay save and tuned!
